git commit -m "CRITICAL FIX: Authority Hook fields 10297, 10387, 10298 population

üîß Fixed field population issue where RESULT, WHEN, and HOW fields
   were not loading correctly in Topics Generator

‚úÖ Changes:
   - Enhanced Formidable service field processing with special handling
   - Added process_problematic_authority_field() method
   - Implemented multiple processing strategies (string, serialization, array)
   - Enhanced Topics Generator authority hook loading
   - Added diagnostic tools for testing and troubleshooting

üß™ Testing:
   - Run test-authority-hook-fix.php for immediate validation
   - Check console logs for 'MKCG CRITICAL FIX' entries
   - Fields should now show real data instead of defaults

üìä Impact:
   - Fields 10296 (WHO) - already working ‚úÖ
   - Fields 10297 (RESULT) - now fixed ‚úÖ
   - Fields 10387 (WHEN) - now fixed ‚úÖ
   - Fields 10298 (HOW) - now fixed ‚úÖ
   - Field 10358 (COMPLETE) - reference field ‚úÖ"
