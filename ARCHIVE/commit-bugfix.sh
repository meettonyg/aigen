git commit -m "🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Questions Generator Topics 4 & 5 Save Failures

ROOT CAUSE FIXED:
- Enhanced get_entry_id_from_post() with 4 lookup strategies
- Fixed dual save strategy (WordPress post meta + Formidable fields)
- Added bulletproof error handling and verification

BEFORE:
❌ Topics 4 & 5 showed save failures
❌ Questions only saved to post meta, not Formidable entries
❌ Users couldn't see saved questions in Formidable form interface

AFTER:
✅ All topics save to both locations reliably
✅ Enhanced entry ID lookup with multiple fallback methods
✅ Real-time save verification and comprehensive error handling
✅ Questions now appear in Formidable form interface

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Enhanced Formidable Service with 4-strategy entry lookup
- Bulletproof dual save (post meta + Formidable fields)
- Save verification system with fallback strategies
- Comprehensive error logging for better debugging
- Entry-based save fallback when post association fails

This fixes the core issue where the frontend showed SUCCESS
but questions weren't visible in Formidable forms."
