git commit -m "ROOT FIX: Authority Hook WHO field now reads from 'audience' taxonomy

‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
- WHO field now pulls from WordPress custom taxonomy 'audience' 
- Multiple audience terms supported (comma-separated)
- 4-level fallback strategy implemented:
  1. Custom taxonomy 'audience' (NEW primary source)
  2. WordPress post meta 'authority_who' (current behavior)  
  3. Formidable field 10296 (existing fallback)
  4. Default 'your audience' (last resort)

üîß TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- Added get_taxonomy_terms_for_who_field() method
- Modified get_authority_hook_data() with taxonomy integration
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Only affects WHO field (other components unchanged)

üéØ RESOLVES: Authority Hook Builder showing 'your audience' instead of actual data
üìç SCOPE: WHO field only, as requested
üîÑ FALLBACK: Comprehensive 4-level strategy for maximum compatibility

echo "3. Test fallback behavior with posts lacking taxonomy data"
echo "4. Validate multiple audience terms display correctly (comma-separated)"
