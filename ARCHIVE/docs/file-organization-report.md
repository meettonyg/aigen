# File Organization Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Directory Structure**
   - Created subdirectories in ARCHIVE:
     - backups/
     - debug/
     - tests/
     - scripts/
     - implementation-reports/
   - Verified existing directories:
     - documentation/
     - legacy-code/
     - debug-diagnostics/

2. **Migrated Files from Main Directory**
   - Moved all debug files to ARCHIVE/debug/
   - Moved all test files to ARCHIVE/tests/
   - Moved implementation reports to ARCHIVE/implementation-reports/
   - Moved backup files to ARCHIVE/backups/
   - Moved script files to ARCHIVE/scripts/

3. **Created Documentation**
   - Added README.md for the ARCHIVE directory
   - Added main README.md for the project
   - Created implementation-log.md for ongoing documentation
   - Created file-organization-plan.md for reference

4. **Cleaned Up Main Directory**
   - Removed unnecessary debug files
   - Moved testing files to appropriate archives
   - Created a docs/ directory for ongoing documentation
   - Ensured main codebase remains clean and focused

## Next Steps

1. Proceed with Phase 1 of the simplification plan: Core Architecture Simplification
2. Refer to the implementation prompts for detailed steps
3. Update the implementation log with progress reports
