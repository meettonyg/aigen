# CRITICAL DATA SOURCE FIX: Topics Generator using wrong data source
# 
# This commit fixes the fundamental issue where Topics Generator was trying to load
# data from Formidable entry fields instead of WordPress custom post meta like Questions Generator.

git commit -m "CRITICAL FIX: Topics Generator data source alignment with Questions Generator

üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:
Topics Generator was looking in WRONG LOCATION for data:
- ‚ùå BEFORE: Tried to load from Formidable entry fields (8498-8502)
- ‚úÖ AFTER: Loads from WordPress custom post meta (topic_1, topic_2, etc.)
- üéØ SAME AS: Questions Generator (which works correctly)

üìä DATA FLOW CORRECTION:
1. Formidable Pro custom action ‚Üí Populates WordPress custom post meta
2. Questions Generator ‚Üí Uses MKCG_Topics_Data_Service ‚Üí Loads from post meta ‚úÖ
3. Topics Generator ‚Üí NOW uses same service ‚Üí Loads from post meta ‚úÖ

üîß ARCHITECTURAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. TOPICS DATA SERVICE INTEGRATION
   - Added topics_data_service property to Topics Generator
   - Initialize MKCG_Topics_Data_Service in constructor (same as Questions Generator)
   - Added is_topics_service_available() helper method

2. REPLACED GET_TEMPLATE_DATA METHOD
   - REMOVED: Complex Formidable entry field processing
   - ADDED: Topics Data Service delegation (loads from custom post meta)
   - Uses get_topics_from_post_direct() internally
   - Same data loading strategy as Questions Generator

3. UPDATED AJAX HANDLERS
   - handle_get_topics_data_ajax() now uses Topics Data Service
   - Consistent error handling and response format
   - Same service delegation pattern as Questions Generator

4. CONSISTENT DATA SOURCE
   - Both generators now load topics from WordPress custom post meta
   - Both use MKCG_Topics_Data_Service for data operations
   - Eliminates data source discrepancy between generators

‚úÖ EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Topics Generator will now populate topic fields with actual data
- Authority hook components continue working (unchanged data source)
- Console output will show populated topic values instead of empty
- Both generators work identically (as user expected)

üß™ VALIDATION STEPS:
1. Navigate to Topics Generator with ?entry=y8ver
2. Check console - should show topic data instead of empty values
3. Verify authority hook still shows 'I help saas founders'
4. Confirm form fields populate with existing topics

üìã FILES MODIFIED:
- includes/generators/class-mkcg-topics-generator.php (core data source fix)

This resolves the fundamental data source mismatch and aligns Topics Generator
with Questions Generator architecture for consistent behavior."
