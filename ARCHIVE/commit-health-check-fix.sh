# CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE FIX: Topics Generator AJAX Health Check Handler
# 
# ISSUE: JavaScript calling mkcg_health_check but no WordPress AJAX handler registered
# ERROR: "Server error: Post ID is required" - 500 errors preventing JSON responses
# 
# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
# - JavaScript topics-generator.js calls performHealthCheck() every 30 seconds
# - performHealthCheck() makes AJAX request to 'mkcg_health_check' 
# - NO WordPress action hook registered for 'wp_ajax_mkcg_health_check'
# - WordPress returns 500 error for unregistered AJAX actions
# 
# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
# 1. Added missing AJAX handler registration in init() method
# 2. Created handle_health_check() method that doesn't require post_id
# 3. Health check now returns proper JSON response with system status
# 
# FILES MODIFIED:
# - includes/generators/class-mkcg-topics-ajax-handlers.php
# 
# IMPACT: 
# - Eliminates 500 errors from health check requests
# - Enables proper JavaScript error recovery and connection monitoring
# - Fixes "Server error: Post ID is required" console errors
# - Restores Topics Generator save functionality
