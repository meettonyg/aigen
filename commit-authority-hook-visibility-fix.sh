git commit -m "ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX: Authority Hook Builder Visibility in Topics Generator

ROOT ISSUE RESOLVED: Enhanced Authority Hook component was included but hidden with no toggle functionality

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
âœ… Added working toggle functionality for 'Edit Components' button
âœ… Created toggleAuthorityHookBuilder() JavaScript function
âœ… Enhanced CSS with smooth animations and proper hiding
âœ… Auto-show builder for users with default authority hooks
âœ… Added comprehensive debug logging and error handling
âœ… Fixed data passing to shared component (generator_type, entry_id)

ENHANCED FEATURES NOW ACCESSIBLE:
âœ… Multiple audience management with checkboxes
âœ… 'Add to List' functionality on examples
âœ… Audience tag system with visual indicators
âœ… Status counters for audience selection
âœ… Read-only WHO field populated from tags
âœ… Smart comma formatting for multiple audiences

FILES MODIFIED:
- templates/generators/topics/default.php (toggle functionality + debug)
- assets/css/mkcg-unified-styles.css (enhanced visibility styles)

TESTING:
1. Clear all caches
2. Go to Topics Generator page
3. Click 'Edit Components' button
4. Verify enhanced Authority Hook Builder appears with full functionality
