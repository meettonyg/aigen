fix: Biography Generator Impact Intro display and validation issues

Root-level fixes applied:
1. Fixed Impact Intro validation to require either Authority Hook OR Impact Intro (not both)
2. Fixed Impact Intro display format to include proper prefixes ("I've" and "My mission is to")
3. Added event listeners to capture updates from centralized Impact Intro Builder
4. Added Authority Hook event listener for consistency
5. Added debug function to help diagnose Impact Intro state issues
6. Created documentation for troubleshooting Impact Intro display problems

Technical changes:
- Modified validateFormData() to use OR logic instead of AND
- Updated updateImpactIntro() to build proper format with prefixes
- Updated collectFormData() to use consistent Impact Intro format
- Added 'impact-intro-updated' and 'authority-hook-updated' event listeners
- Added debugImpactIntro() debug function

This ensures Biography Generator works when either Authority Hook OR Impact Intro is completed, and displays Impact Intro correctly when values are entered.
