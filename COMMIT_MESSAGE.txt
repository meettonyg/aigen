ðŸ”§ Fix Tagline Generator: Impact Intro population & Edit Component buttons

ROOT-LEVEL FIXES (No patches or workarounds):

## Issue 1: Impact Intro not dynamically populating from ?post_id querystring
**Root Cause**: Pods service was missing Impact Intro data loading method
**Solution**: Added complete Impact Intro integration to Pods service
- âœ… Added get_impact_intro_components() method using Impact Intro Service
- âœ… Added save_impact_intro_components() method for data persistence
- âœ… Added get_empty_impact_intro() helper method
- âœ… Updated get_guest_data() to include 'impact_intro_components'

## Issue 2: Edit Component buttons not working
**Root Cause**: Event delegation scoped too narrowly + field selector mismatch
**Solution**: Enhanced event system and corrected field mappings
- âœ… Changed from container-level to document-level event delegation
- âœ… Enhanced toggleBuilder() with detailed debugging and verification
- âœ… Fixed field selector mismatch: #mkcg-impact-where â†’ #mkcg-where
- âœ… Fixed field selector mismatch: #mkcg-impact-why â†’ #mkcg-why
- âœ… Updated all field mapping methods (updateImpactIntroInputs, populateImpactIntroFields, bindServiceInputs)
- âœ… Added button text updates to reflect toggle state
- âœ… Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- includes/services/class-mkcg-pods-service.php (Impact Intro integration)
- assets/js/generators/tagline-generator.js (Event system & field mappings)

**Testing**: Both issues should now be resolved with proper data loading and working edit buttons.
