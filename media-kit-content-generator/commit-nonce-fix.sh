git commit -m "🔧 CRITICAL FIX: WordPress nonce security validation for inline topic editing

🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED:
- Inline topic editing failed backend save with 'Security check failed'  
- Frontend sync worked perfectly via centralized data manager
- Backend persistence blocked by nonce validation mismatch

✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

📱 PHASE 1: PHP Nonce Handling  
- Updated main plugin: unified nonce creation strategy
- Fixed Questions Generator: proper nonce validation for mkcg_save_topic action
- Enhanced save handlers: consistent nonce verification across all AJAX endpoints
- Aligned nonce actions: mkcg_nonce, mkcg_save_nonce

📱 PHASE 2: JavaScript Nonce Access
- Fixed JavaScript: access nonces from localized variables (questions_vars)
- Removed hardcoded nonce element lookups  
- Enhanced AJAX requests: multiple nonce fields for compatibility
- Added nonce validation at startup with debugging

🔄 RESULT:
- ✅ Inline topic editing now saves to backend successfully
- ✅ Frontend sync continues to work perfectly  
- ✅ Proper WordPress security standards maintained
- ✅ Cross-generator synchronization preserved
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging for debugging

📊 IMPACT:
- Backend persistence: FIXED ✅  
- Frontend functionality: MAINTAINED ✅
- Security compliance: ENHANCED ✅  
- User experience: IMPROVED ✅"
