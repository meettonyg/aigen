ðŸ§¹ CLEAN SLATE: Complete removal of ALL default placeholder text

ISSUE: User wanted NO default placeholders like "your audience", "achieve their goals", etc.

CLEAN SLATE SOLUTION:
- REMOVED all backward compatibility logic completely
- REMOVED all conditional behavior based on entry parameters
- REMOVED all default fallback text ("your audience", "achieve their goals", "they need help", "through your method")

IMPLEMENTATION:
- updateAuthorityHook(): ONLY shows text when ALL 4 fields have real data, otherwise empty
- collectAudienceData(): Returns empty string, NEVER "your audience" 
- saveAllData(): Only creates complete text when all fields filled
- generateTopics(): Requires complete authority hook before allowing generation
- PHP template: Always uses empty values, no defaults ever
- Authority hook display: Empty unless all components exist

CHANGES:
- assets/js/generators/topics-generator.js - Removed ALL default logic
- templates/generators/topics/default.php - Removed conditional defaults
- test-empty-field-fix.php - Updated for clean slate testing
- CLEAN-SLATE-COMPLETE.md - Comprehensive documentation

TESTING:
- Empty fields: Shows completely empty (no placeholders)
- Partial fields: Still shows empty (no defaults)
- Complete fields: Shows full authority hook text
- Save operations: Only saves real data, never placeholders

RESULT: Perfect clean slate - NO default placeholders anywhere, ever!
