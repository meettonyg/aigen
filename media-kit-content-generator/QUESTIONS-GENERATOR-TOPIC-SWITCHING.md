# Questions Generator Topic Switching Implementation

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where selecting a topic in the Questions Generator wasn't changing the displayed question fields. Now when a user selects a topic:
1. The heading updates to show the selected topic text
2. The question fields change to show the correct set (1-5 for Topic 1, 6-10 for Topic 2, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Question Set Switching Logic
- Added a new `showQuestionsForTopic` method that:
  - Hides all question sets first
  - Shows only the question set corresponding to the selected topic
  - Uses the pattern `#mkcg-topic-${topicId}-questions` to identify question sets in the DOM

### 2. Enhanced Topic Selection
- Modified the `selectTopic` method to call the new `updateSelectedTopicHeading` method
- Ensured the heading displays the correct topic text
- Added proper debug logging for topic selection events

### 3. Streamlined the Code
- Removed cross-generator communication code as requested
- Focused the implementation on standalone functionality
- Simplified initialization to work without dependencies

### 4. Updated Field Selection
- Modified the question field selection to use the topic number in the selector
- Added field selector pattern: `#mkcg-question-field-${topicId}-${questionNumber}`

## How to Test
1. Open the Questions Generator
2. Select different topics from the topic grid
3. Verify that:
   - The heading updates to show the selected topic
   - The question set changes to show the correct fields for that topic
   - Generating questions works for the selected topic

## Files Modified
- `assets/js/generators/questions-generator.js`: Updated with new topic switching logic
- `templates/generators/questions/default.php`: Simplified initialization script

This implementation ensures that users see the correct question fields for each selected topic, providing a better user experience and making the form more intuitive.
