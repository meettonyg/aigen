# ROOT-LEVEL FIXES IMPLEMENTED - WordPress Plugin Issue Resolution

## 🎯 ISSUE SUMMARY
**Problem:** WordPress error "WordPress not found. Please check the path." when accessing:
`https://guestify.ai/wp-content/plugins/media-kit-content-generator/test-authority-hook-fix.php?frm_action=edit&entry=y8ver`

**Root Cause:** Test script was using hardcoded WordPress path detection that failed in development environment.

## 🔧 ROOT-LEVEL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ENHANCED WORDPRESS DETECTION (test-authority-hook-fix.php)
**Problem:** Hardcoded path `../../../../wp-config.php` failed
**Fix:** Implemented multi-path detection with fallbacks

```php
// Before (FAILED)
$wp_config_path = dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../../wp-config.php';

// After (ROOT-LEVEL FIX)
function detect_and_load_wordpress() {
    // Multiple detection strategies
    $possible_paths = [
        // Standard, development, document root, alternative paths
    ];
    // Enhanced error handling and logging
}
```

### 2. COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING
**Problem:** Generic error messages without helpful guidance
**Fix:** Enhanced error reporting with actionable recommendations

- ✅ Multiple WordPress path detection strategies
- ✅ Detailed error messages with suggested solutions  
- ✅ Environment diagnostics and status reporting
- ✅ Graceful degradation for missing components

### 3. WORDPRESS ADMIN INTEGRATION
**Problem:** Standalone script outside WordPress architecture
**Fix:** Created proper WordPress admin panel integration

**New Admin Panel:** `WordPress Admin > Tools > Authority Hook Test`

```php
// ROOT-LEVEL FIX: Proper WordPress plugin architecture
class MKCG_Authority_Hook_Test_Admin {
    // Admin menu integration
    // User permissions checking
    // WordPress-native UI components
}
```

### 4. MAIN PLUGIN ENHANCEMENTS
**Problem:** No integration between test script and main plugin
**Fix:** Enhanced main plugin with admin integration

- ✅ Added admin test page loading to dependency system
- ✅ Enhanced admin notices for better user experience
- ✅ Global debugging functions for troubleshooting
- ✅ Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
