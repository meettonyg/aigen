# Topic Sync Implementation for Media Kit Content Generator

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where the Questions Generator wasn't updating its heading when a Topic was selected from the Topics Generator. Now, when a user selects a topic, the Questions generator heading is automatically updated to reflect the selected topic.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced FormUtils with Event System
Added a robust event system to the shared `MKCG_FormUtils` that allows cross-generator communication:
- Event subscription with `MKCG_FormUtils.events.on(eventName, callback)`
- Event broadcasting with `MKCG_FormUtils.events.trigger(eventName, data)`
- In-memory data sharing across generators with `MKCG_FormUtils.data.set()` and `MKCG_FormUtils.data.get()`

### 2. Topics Generator Updates
- Modified the `selectTopic` and `useTopicInField` methods to broadcast topic selection events
- Implemented data caching in FormUtils for reliable state management
- Added event broadcasting when a topic is selected or used

### 3. Questions Generator Updates
- Added a new `setupCrossGeneratorEvents` method that listens for topic selection events
- Created a new `updateSelectedTopicHeading` method to update the heading display
- Enhanced initialization to wait for FormUtils to be loaded before initializing
- Added bidirectional communication so Questions Generator can also broadcast topic changes

### 4. Template Updates
- Added ID `mkcg-questions-heading` to the Questions Generator heading
- Updated the script initialization to ensure proper dependency loading

### 5. Testing
- Created a test HTML page `test-topic-syncing.html` to verify event communication

## How to Test
1. Open the Questions Generator
2. Select a different topic card from the topic grid
3. Verify that the heading updates to show the selected topic

## Technical Benefits
- **Loosely coupled architecture**: Generators communicate through events, not direct dependencies
- **Consistent state management**: Uses shared FormUtils for data persistence
- **Cross-generator communication**: Easy to extend to other generators
- **Improved user experience**: Dynamic updates with no page refresh required

## Files Modified
- `mkcg-form-utils.js`: Added event system and data sharing
- `topics-generator.js`: Added event broadcasting for topic selection
- `questions-generator.js`: Added event listening and heading updates
- `templates/generators/questions/default.php`: Added heading ID and enhanced initialization

## Future Work
As discussed, this implementation doesn't persist data between pages yet. In the future, we will integrate with Formidable Forms to save the selected topic when a user navigates between generators.

This implementation follows the unified architecture approach from the implementation plan, making it easy to maintain and extend as new generators are added to the system.
