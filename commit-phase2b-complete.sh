git commit -m "PHASE 2B COMPLETE: Enterprise-Grade UX Enhancements & Offline Capability

üéØ PHASE 2B IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
‚úÖ Enhanced Auto-Save with Professional Visual Feedback
‚úÖ Progressive Loading States with Multi-Stage Indicators  
‚úÖ Complete Offline Capability with Request Queuing
‚úÖ Advanced Error Handling with User-Friendly Messages
‚úÖ Professional Animations and Visual Polish
‚úÖ Network Awareness and Status Indicators
‚úÖ Comprehensive Integration into Topics Generator

üìÅ MODIFIED FILES:
‚Ä¢ assets/js/generators/topics-generator.js - Enhanced with offline support & visual feedback
‚Ä¢ assets/js/enhanced-ui-feedback.js - Added field state styling & animations
‚Ä¢ assets/js/mkcg-offline-manager.js - NEW: Complete offline handling system
